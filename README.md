## Dotfiles

This repository contains my . files to help me to clone my preferences accross different machines.

### Take a Look

If you want to see these dotfiles in action before cloning to your machine use
Vagrant:

```sh
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant
./setup
```

The above commands should bring the vagrant vm up and run the setup.sh. After
that you can take a look on how it looks like in the vagrant vm.
